based on nadavsavio Next Artboard.sketchplugin

What it does:
Navigate to another artboard through your arrowkeys
Instead of going to the next/previous artboard based on the layers order, this one takes the position within the canvas into account.
E.g. if you want to navigate to the next artboard to the right you hit 
shift-control-arrowright, independent from the layers hierarchy. 

Also, the canvas gets centred without correlating with the actual canvas zoomvalue.
If an artboard is bigger than your canvas, you will see the top right corner of an artboard.

Shortcuts:

artboard to the right: shift control arrowright
artboard to the left: shift control arrowleft
artboard above: shift control arrowup
artboard underneath: shift control arrowdown

Upcoming tasks:
cleanup messy code
improve tolerance handling
